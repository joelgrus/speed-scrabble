## üîß CRITICAL: Code Quality & Engineering Foundation

**Status**: Must complete before adding new features
**Assessment**: Codebase has solid architecture but critical gaps in testing, error handling, and reliability

### üö® Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

#### **Testing Infrastructure - ZERO COVERAGE**
- [ ] **Set up testing framework**
  - [ ] Install Jest + React Testing Library + @testing-library/jest-dom
  - [ ] Configure test scripts in package.json
  - [ ] Set up test environment with proper TypeScript support
  - [ ] Add coverage reporting (aim for 80%+ on core logic)

- [ ] **Core Game Logic Tests** (Priority 1)
  - [ ] `bag.ts`: Test tile distribution, shuffling determinism, edge cases
  - [ ] `validator.ts`: Test word validation, connectivity checking, edge cases
  - [ ] `board.ts`: Test word extraction, placement logic, coordinate handling
  - [ ] `rng.ts`: Test seeded randomness, deterministic output
  - [ ] `letterValues.ts`: Test all letter mappings exist

- [ ] **State Management Tests** (Priority 2)  
  - [ ] `gameStore.ts`: Test all state transitions, side effects, persistence
  - [ ] Test race conditions in async operations (autoDraw, validation)
  - [ ] Test edge cases: empty rack, full board, invalid moves
  - [ ] Test dump mechanics: tile return, bag shuffling, draw counts

- [ ] **Component Integration Tests** (Priority 3)
  - [ ] `useKeyboard.ts`: Test all keyboard interactions, prevent default behavior
  - [ ] `PlacedTileComponent.tsx`: Test click/touch interactions, hover states
  - [ ] `TileRack.tsx`: Test tile selection, dump mode, animations

#### **Error Handling & Resilience**

  - [ ] Cache validation results and invalidate strategically

- [ ] **State Update Batching**
  - [ ] Batch related state updates into single operations
  - [ ] Use React 18 automatic batching where possible
  - [ ] Minimize unnecessary re-renders in child components

## üìù Implementation Notes

**Current Status**: Visual polish complete ‚úÖ ‚Üí **NEXT**: Engineering foundation
**Critical Path**: Must fix code quality issues before adding timed gameplay
**Target**: Transform into a reliable, maintainable, fast-paced word game

The visual transformation is complete and the game looks professional. However, the codebase needs a solid engineering foundation with comprehensive tests, error handling, and performance optimizations before adding complex features like timed gameplay. This investment in code quality will ensure long-term maintainability and reliability.
